# Bella Clothes

## About the project

This project is a e-commerce created only by me during a coronavirus pandemic for learning purposes only.
I started this project to improve my knowledge of FullStack, mainly in the BackEnd part, where it was my first "real" application created with the **Nodejs** framework.
The architecture used in the project is the **MVCS (Models Views Controllers Services)**
